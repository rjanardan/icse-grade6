          <h3>Unit 6: Home on the Veld</h3> 
          <div>
            <pre>
My mother was in charge of three rondavels at 
Qunu which, as I remember, were always filled
with the children of my relations. In fact, I 
can hardly remember any occasion as a child 
when I was alone. In African culture, the sons 
and daughters of one's aunts and uncles are
considered brothers and sisters, not cousins.
My mother's sister is my mother and my brother's
child is my son or my daughter.
            </pre>

            <p class=question>1. What was the author's mother
              responsible for?
            <p class=answer>A. Nelson Mandela's mother was
              responsible for taking care of 3 houses and families.
              She was responsible for household chores, taking care
              of children and their needs.

            <p class=question>2. What is the reason that the
              author was never alone in his childhood?
            <p class=answer>A. In the village where Nelson Mandela
              grew up, families used to stay together, eat together
              and played together. There were so many children of
              his uncle and aunts, that he never was alone.

            <p class=question>3. Describe family relationships
              in African culture.
            <p class=answer>A. In African culture, they lived
              as joint family. Children of brothers and sisters
              were together. The sons and daughters of one's
              uncles and aunts are considered brothers and sisters,
              not cousins. Also, uncle and aunt are called father
              and mother.

            <p class=question>4. Compare relationships in the
              African culture with that of what you share within
              your own family.
            <p class=answer>A. Compared to how Nelson Mandela
              grew up, it is different in my family. Me and my
              cousin stay in different houses, but near by. We
              meet occasionally and have fun going to restaurants
              together. We meet on birthdays and greet each other.
              
            <pre>
It was in the fields that I learned  how to knock brids out of the sky
with  slingshot, to  gather wind  honey, fruits  and edible  roots, to
drink warm, sweet  milk straight from the  udder of a cow,  to swim in
the clear, cold  streams, and to catch fish with  string and sharpened
bits  of wire.  I learned  to  stick fight  - essential  to any  rural
African boy - and became skilled in its various techniques.
            </pre>

            <p class=question>1. What did the author learn in
              his childhood?
            <p class=answer>A. Nelson Mandela lived in a
              village with near by fields. He learnt how
              to gather wild honey, fruits and edible roots.
              He learnt how to dring milk directly from udder
              of a cow. He also learnt how to catch fish and
              knock birds using slingshot.

            <p class=question>2. What was considered as the
              essential skill for African boys?
              
            <p class=answer>A. Nelson Mandela learnt various
              things like Of the many things Nelson Mandela
              learnt during early childhood. One thing that was
              essential knowledge was stick-fight. He became
              skilled in various techniques.

            <p class=question>3. Do you think the author had
              a happy childhood in spite of poverty? Give
              reasons for your answer.
            <p class=answer>A. Yes, author had happy childhood.
              He had children around him always and huge open
              spaces to play. He had fun learning gathering of
              honey, catch fish and knock birds.

          <h3>Unit 8: Don Quixote Fights Some Giants</h3>
          <div>
            <p class=question>1. Whom did Don Quixote choose as his
              squire? How did he persuade him to become his squire?
            <p class=answer>A. Don Quixote chose Sancho Panza as
              his squire. Sancho Panza was a poor man. Don persuaded
              Sancho by promising many adventures. He also promised to
              make him governor of the islands they will conquer together.

            <p class="question">2. What arrangements did Don Quixote
              and his squire make for their adventures?
            <p class="answer">A. Sancho has brought his donkey with
              him as he did not own a horse. Sancho brought
              leather-bottle with full of water and empty saddlebags
              to receive the things they would win in their contests.

            <p class="question">3. Whom did Don Quixote mistake
              for giants? How did Sancho Panza try to correct his master?
              
            <p class="answer">A. Don mistook windmills for giants.
              He said some of the giants had arms more than six miles
              long. Sancho tried to correct his master. They are not
              giants but windmills. Arms are actually sails. But
              still Don thought they were giants.

            <p class="question">4. What was the result of Don Quixote's
                fight with the 'giants'?
            <p class="answer">A. Don attacked the nearest windmill,
                pushing his spear in to the sail. The sail rotated fast
                and broke the spear into many pieces. It threw Don
                and Rozinante down.

              <p class="question">5. How did he react to his defeat?
              <p class="answer">A. Don said that in war one's fortune
                can change easily. He said some magician had turned
                giants into windmills so that he would not be able
                to conquer them. But still Don had hope to win.

              <p class=question>"Some  knights made their squires  wait for many
              years. I shall not be like that.  I may win a kingdom in six days'

              <li class="question">b. What did the  knight and his squire carry

                  mistook as giants.</p>
              </ol>      
              <p class=question>2.  At that  moment, the  wind rose  and the
                sails of the windmills began to move.
                "Move your arms as much as  you like, you will not stop me!"
                Don Quixote shouted when he saw this.

                <li class=question>Do you think Sancho did right thing serving Don as master?</li>
                <p class=answer>No,  Sancho  should not  have  served
                  Don. Serving a fooling master is futile (waste).</p>
                
                <li class=question>Do you think Sancho did right thing joining Don
                Quixote?</li>
                <p class=answer>Sancho  was poor and did  not have any
                other option. Still serving a foolish master is futile
                  and sometimes dangerous.</p>

                <li class=question>Do you think  Sancho was poor? Give
                reasons.</li>
                <p class=answer>Yes, Sancho was  poor. He did not have
                a horse, but only donkey.  He joined Don with dream of
                  becoming rich.</p>

                <li  class=question>If you  were in  Sancho's place,
