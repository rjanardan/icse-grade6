              I can just shut my eyes and think</br>
            	that the shadows are growing darker</br>
            	under the Madar tree, and the water</br>
            	in the pond looks shiny black.</br>

            <p class=bg-primary>Why does the speaker have to shut his or her eyes to imagine this?
            <p class=bg-success>Ans: Because it was afternoon and broad day light.

            <p class=bg-primary>What time is it actually? What is the speaker doing?
            <p class=bg-success>Ans: It was 12 noon. Speaker was studying.

            <p class=bg-primary>Who is the speaker trying to convince?
            <p class=bg-success>Ans: Mother

            <p class=bg-primary>2.    If twelve o’clock can come in the night,
             	Why can’t the night come when it is twelve o’clock?

            <p class=bg-primary>Which twelve o’clock is the speaker making a reference to - twelve in the afternoon or in the night?
            <p class=bg-success>Ans: Twelve in the night

            <p class=bg-primary>Why does the speaker want the night to come when it is twelve o’clock?
            <p class=bg-success>Ans: so that he can stop studies early.

            <p class=bg-primary>If night came in early at twelve o’clock, it would be very long one indeed! What would you do on such a long night? Would you like it?
            <p class=bg-success>Ans: I do not like long night. There is little I can do in the night. I like long day as I can play with friends outside, go for picnic and my favourite sport cricket.
